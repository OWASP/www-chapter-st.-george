Our meetings are open to the public, and you do not need to be a member to attend. Please do consider [joining OWASP](https://owasp.org/membership/) if you find our community, projects, and meetings valuable, or sponsoring this chapter.

### Participation

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Our mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a free and open software license.
