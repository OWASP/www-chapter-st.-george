Welcome to the St. George chapter homepage.

Membership is encouraged but not required to use OWASP materials or to participate in chapter meetings or volunteering to help with an OWASP project. Everyone is welcome to join us at our chapter meetings. 

### Events

Find us at [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-st-george-ut/). All chapter OWASP events and activities are announced and tracked at this site. 

### Participation

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Our mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a free and open software license.
